To avoid exhausting source TCP ports (they tend to get stuck in TIME_WAIT),
you'll need to set these sysctl values (taken from
https://github.com/nf/goto/tree/master/bench)

Linux:
	sudo sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_tw_recycle=1
	sudo sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse=1 (may not be necessary)
OS X:
	sudo sysctl -w net.inet.tcp.msl=1000
